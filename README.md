# CoreShell
A custom Linux shell built in C to demonstrate fundamental OS concepts. Features process management (fork, exec), IPC via pipes (|), I/O redirection (&lt;, >), and full job control (&amp;, fg, bg). A practical dive into the mechanics of how command-line interpreters work from the ground up.
